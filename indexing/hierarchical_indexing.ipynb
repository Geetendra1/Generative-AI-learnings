    "# Hierarchical Indices in Document Retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This code implements a Hierarchical Indexing system for document retrieval, utilizing two levels of encoding: document-level summaries and detailed chunks. This approach aims to improve the efficiency and relevance of information retrieval by first identifying relevant document sections through summaries, then drilling down to specific details within those sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Traditional flat indexing methods can struggle with large documents or corpus, potentially missing context or returning irrelevant information. Hierarchical indexing addresses this by creating a two-tier search system, allowing for more efficient and context-aware retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components\n",
    "- **PDF processing and text chunking**\n",
    "- **Asynchronous document summarization using OpenAI's GPT-4**\n",
    "- **Vector store creation for both summaries and detailed chunks using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings**\n",
    "- **Custom hierarchical retrieval function**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Document Preprocessing and Encoding\n",
    "1. The PDF is loaded and split into documents (likely by page).\n",
    "2. Each document is summarized asynchronously using GPT-4.\n",
    "3. The original documents are also split into smaller, detailed chunks.\n",
    "4. Two separate vector stores are created:\n",
    "   - One for document-level summaries\n",
    "   - One for detailed chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asynchronous Processing and Rate Limiting\n",
    "- The code uses asynchronous programming (`asyncio`) to improve efficiency.\n",
    "- Implements batching and exponential backoff to handle API rate limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Retrieval\n",
    "The `retrieve_hierarchical` function implements the two-tier search:\n",
    "1. It first searches the summary vector store to identify relevant document sections.\n",
    "2. For each relevant summary, it then searches the detailed chunk vector store, filtering by the corresponding page number.\n",
    "3. This approach ensures that detailed information is retrieved only from the most relevant document sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of this Approach\n",
    "- **Improved Retrieval Efficiency:** By first searching summaries, the system can quickly identify relevant document sections without processing all detailed chunks.\n",
    "- **Better Context Preservation:** The hierarchical approach helps maintain the broader context of retrieved information.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** This method is particularly beneficial for large documents or corpus, where flat searching might be inefficient or miss important context.\n",
    "- **Flexibility:** The system allows for adjusting the number of summaries and chunks retrieved, enabling fine-tuning for different use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "- **Asynchronous Programming:** Utilizes Python's `asyncio` for efficient I/O operations and API calls.\n",
    "- **Rate Limit Handling:** Implements batching and exponential backoff to manage API rate limits effectively.\n",
    "- **Persistent Storage:** Saves the generated vector stores locally to avoid unnecessary recomputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Hierarchical indexing represents a sophisticated approach to document retrieval, particularly suitable for large or complex document sets. By leveraging both high-level summaries and detailed chunks, it offers a balance between broad context understanding and specific information retrieval. This method has potential applications in various fields requiring efficient and context-aware information retrieval, such as legal document analysis, academic research, or large-scale content management systems.\n"

The term \\n\"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature, \\nprecipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human \\nactivities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly \\ncontributed to climate change.  \\nHistorical Context  \\nThe Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have \\nbeen seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about \\n11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and  human civilization. \\nMost of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that \\nchange the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which \\nbegan at the end of the last ice age, human societies f lourished, but the industrial era has seen \\nunprecedented changes.  \\nModern Observations  \\nModern scientific observations indicate a rapid increase in global temperatures, sea levels, \\nand extreme weather events. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has \\ndocumented these changes extensively. Ice core samples, tree rings, and ocean sediments \\nprovide a historical record that scientists use to understand past climate conditions and \\npredict future trends. The evidence overwhelmingly shows that recent changes are primarily \\ndriven by human activities, particularly the emission of greenhou se gases.  \\nChapter 2: Causes of Climate Change  \\nGreenhouse Gases  \\nThe primary cause of recent climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases in the \\natmosphere. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous \\noxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, creating a \"greenhouse effect.\" This effect is  essential \\nfor life on Earth, as it keeps the planet warm enough to support life. However, human \\nactivities have intensified this natural process, leading to a warmer climate.  \\nFossil Fuels  \\nBurning fossil fuels for energy releases large amounts of CO2. This includes coal, oil, and \\nnatural gas used for electricity, heating, and transportation. The industrial revolution marked \\nthe beginning of a significant increase in fossil fuel consumption, which continues to rise \\ntoday.  \\nCoal  '), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='Coal is the most carbon -intensive fossil fuel, and its use for electricity generation is a major \\nsource of CO2 emissions. Despite a decline in some regions, coal remains a significant \\nenergy source globally. It is mined extensively in countries like China,  India, and the United \\nStates, contributing significantly to their energy supplies and CO2 footprints.  \\nOil \\nOil is used primarily for transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel. The combustion of \\noil products releases significant amounts of CO2 and other pollutants, contributing to climate \\nchange and air quality issues. The global oil industry is vast, in volving extraction, refining, \\nand distribution, with significant geopolitical and economic implications.  \\nNatural Gas  \\nNatural gas is the least carbon -intensive fossil fuel and is often seen as a \"bridge fuel\" to a \\nlower -carbon future. However, its extraction and use still contribute to greenhouse gas \\nemissions, particularly methane, which is a potent greenhouse gas. Innov ations in fracking \\ntechnology have made natural gas more accessible, but this comes with environmental and \\nhealth concerns.  \\nDeforestation  \\nForests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. When trees are cut down \\nfor timber or to clear land for agriculture, this stored carbon is released back into the \\natmosphere. Deforestation reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2, exa cerbating the \\ngreenhouse effect.  \\nTropical Deforestation  \\nTropical rainforests are particularly important for carbon storage. Deforestation in the \\nAmazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia has significant impacts on global carbon cycles \\nand biodiversity. These regions are often cleared for agriculture, logging, and  mining, leading \\nto habitat loss and species extinction.  \\nBoreal Forests  \\nBoreal forests, found in the northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia, also play a \\ncrucial role in sequestering carbon. Logging and land -use changes in these regions contribute \\nto climate change. These forests are vital for regulating the Earth\\' s climate and supporting \\nindigenous communities and wildlife.  \\nAgriculture  \\nAgriculture contributes to climate change through methane emissions from livestock, rice \\npaddies, and the use of synthetic fertilizers. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas with a much \\nhigher heat -trapping capability than CO2, albeit in smaller quantities.  \\nLivestock Emissions  '), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf', 'page': 2}, page_content='Ruminant animals, such as cows and sheep, produce methane during digestion. Manure \\nmanagement practices also contribute to methane and nitrous oxide emissions. Innovations in \\nlivestock feeding and waste management can help mitigate these emissions.  \\nRice Cultivation  \\nFlooded rice paddies create anaerobic conditions that lead to methane production. Improved \\nwater management and rice varieties can help reduce these emissions. Research into \\nsustainable rice farming practices is crucial for balancing food security and clim ate goals.  \\nFertilizers  \\nThe use of synthetic fertilizers in agriculture releases nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas. \\nPractices such as precision farming and organic fertilizers can mitigate these emissions. The \\ndevelopment of eco -friendly fertilizers and farming techniques is  essential for reducing the \\nagricultural sector\\'s carbon footprint.  \\nChapter 3: Effects of Climate Change  \\nThe effects of climate change are already being felt around the world and are projected to \\nintensify in the coming decades. These effects include:  \\nRising Temperatures  \\nGlobal temperatures have risen by about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since \\nthe late 19th century. This warming is not uniform, with some regions experiencing more \\nsignificant increases than others.  \\nHeatwaves  \\nHeatwaves are becoming more frequent and severe, posing risks to human health, agriculture, \\nand infrastructure. Cities are particularly vulnerable due to the \"urban heat island\" effect. \\nHeatwaves can lead to heat -related illnesses and exacerbate existing h ealth conditions.  \\nChanging Seasons  \\nClimate change is altering the timing and length of seasons, affecting ecosystems and human \\nactivities. For example, spring is arriving earlier, and winters are becoming shorter and \\nmilder in many regions. This shift disrupts plant and animal life cycles a nd agricultural \\npractices.  \\nMelting Ice and Rising Sea Levels  \\nWarmer temperatures are causing polar ice caps and glaciers to melt, contributing to rising \\nsea levels. Sea levels have risen by about 20 centimeters (8 inches) in the past century, \\nthreatening coastal communities and ecosystems.  \\nPolar Ice Melt  '), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, leading to significant ice \\nloss. Antarctic ice sheets are also losing mass, contributing to sea level rise. This melting \\naffects global ocean currents and weather patterns.  \\nGlacial Retreat  \\nGlaciers around the world are retreating, affecting water supplies for millions of people. \\nRegions dependent on glacial meltwater, such as the Himalayas and the Andes, face \\nparticular risks. Glacial melt also impacts hydropower generation and agriculture.  \\nCoastal Erosion  \\nRising sea levels and increased storm surges are accelerating coastal erosion, threatening \\nhomes, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Low -lying islands and coastal regions are especially \\nvulnerable. Coastal communities must invest in adaptation measures like s ea walls and \\nmanaged retreats.  \\nExtreme Weather Events  \\nClimate change is linked to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather \\nevents, such as hurricanes, heatwaves, droughts, and heavy rainfall. These events can have \\ndevastating impacts on communities, economies, and ecosystems.  \\nHurricanes and Typhoons  \\nWarmer ocean temperatures can intensify hurricanes and typhoons, leading to more \\ndestructive storms. Coastal regions are at heightened risk of storm surge and flooding. Early \\nwarning systems and resilient infrastructure are critical for mitigating these ri sks. \\nDroughts  \\nIncreased temperatures and changing precipitation patterns are contributing to more frequent \\nand severe droughts. This affects agriculture, water supply, and ecosystems, particularly in \\narid and semi -arid regions. Droughts can lead to food and water shorta ges and exacerbate \\nconflicts.  \\nFlooding  \\nHeavy rainfall events are becoming more common, leading to increased flooding. Urban \\nareas with poor drainage and infrastructure are particularly at risk. Flood management \\nstrategies include improved drainage systems, green infrastructure, and floodplain r estoration.  \\nOcean Acidification  \\nIncreased CO2 levels in the atmosphere lead to higher concentrations of CO2 in the oceans. \\nThis causes the water to become more acidic, which can harm marine life, particularly \\norganisms with calcium carbonate shells or skeletons, such as corals and some s hellfish.  \\nCoral Reefs  '), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf', 'page': 4}, page_content='Coral reefs are highly sensitive to changes in temperature and acidity. Ocean acidification \\nand warming waters contribute to coral bleaching and mortality, threatening biodiversity and \\nfisheries. Protecting and restoring coral reefs is essential for marine  conservation.  \\nMarine Ecosystems  \\nAcidification affects the health and survival of various marine species, disrupting food webs \\nand ecosystems. This has implications for commercial fisheries and the livelihoods of people \\nwho depend on the ocean. Efforts to reduce CO2 emissions and enhance marine protected \\nareas are vital.  \\nChapter 4: Mitigation and Adaptation  \\nAddressing climate change requires a two -pronged approach: mitigation and adaptation. \\nMitigation involves reducing or preventing the emission of greenhouse gases, while \\nadaptation involves making adjustments to social, economic, and environmental practices  to \\nminimize the damage caused by climate change.  \\nRenewable Energy  \\nTransitioning to renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, is \\ncrucial for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These sources produce little to no emissions \\nand are sustainable in the long term.  \\nSolar Power  \\nSolar power harnesses energy from the sun using photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems. \\nIt is a versatile and scalable solution for reducing carbon emissions. Advances in solar \\ntechnology and decreasing costs make it an attractive option for many regi ons. \\nWind Power  \\nWind power generates electricity using wind turbines. It is one of the fastest -growing \\nrenewable energy sources and has significant potential for large -scale deployment. Offshore \\nwind farms offer substantial opportunities for expansion.  \\nHydroelectric Power  \\nHydroelectric power generates electricity by harnessing the energy of flowing water. It is a \\nmature and widely used technology, although it can have environmental impacts on river \\necosystems. Balancing energy needs with ecological conservation is essential . \\nEnergy Efficiency  \\nImproving energy efficiency in buildings, transportation, and industry can significantly \\nreduce emissions. This includes using energy -efficient appliances, improving insulation, and \\ndeveloping more fuel -efficient vehicles.  \\nBuilding Efficiency  '), Document(metadata={'source': '../data/Understanding_Climate_Change.pdf', 'page': 5}, page_content='Energy -efficient buildings use less energy for heating, cooling, and lighting. This can be \\nachieved through better insulation, energy -efficient windows, and smart building \\ntechnologies. Retrofitting existing buildings is also crucial for enhancing efficien cy. \\nTransportation Efficiency  \\nImproving the fuel efficiency of vehicles, promoting public transportation, and supporting \\nelectric vehicles can reduce emissions from the transportation sector. Investments in \\nsustainable transport infrastructure are vital for reducing carbon footprints.  \\nIndustrial Efficiency  \\nEnhancing the energy efficiency of industrial processes and equipment can reduce emissions \\nand lower operating costs. This includes upgrading machinery, optimizing production \\nprocesses, and recovering waste heat. Innovations in industrial practices are key  to achieving \\nsustainability goals.  \\nReforestation and Afforestation  \\nPlanting trees and restoring forests can help absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. Reforestation \\ninvolves replanting trees in deforested areas, while afforestation involves planting trees in \\nareas that were not previously forested.  \\nReforestation Projects  \\nReforestation projects aim to restore degraded lands and increase forest cover. These projects \\ncan provide additional benefits, such as biodiversity conservation and improved water \\nmanagement. Community involvement and sustainable practices are crucial for  successful \\nreforestation.  \\nAfforestation Initiatives  \\nAfforestation initiatives involve creating new forests on lands that have not been forested for \\na long time. These projects can help sequester carbon and provide new habitats for wildlife. \\nStrategic planning and ecological considerations are essential for maximizing benefits.  \\nClimate Policy  \\nEffective climate policy is essential for driving large -scale change. International agreements, \\nsuch as the Paris Agreement, aim to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius \\nabove pre -industrial levels. National and local policies also play a cr itical role in \\nimplementing mitigation and adaptation strategies.  \\nInternational Agreements  \\nInternational climate agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement, set \\ntargets and frameworks for reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally.
