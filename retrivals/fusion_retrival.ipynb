The term  \"global climate\" encompasses the planet\\'s overall weather patterns, including temperature,  precipitation, and wind patterns, over an extended period. Over the past cent ury, human  activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly  contributed to climate change.   Historical Context   The Earth\\'s climate has changed throughout history. Over the past 650,000 years, there have  been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat, with the abrupt end of the last ice age about  11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era and  human civilization.  Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth\\'s orbit that  change the amount of solar energy our planet receives. During the Holocene epoch, which'"
